# Real-World-Data-Wrangling-with-Python
# Project Overview
In this project, we tackle the complexities of real-world data by performing a complete data-wrangling process using Python and its powerful libraries. Real-world data is rarely clean and often exists in varied formats and sources. This project walks through essential steps in data wrangling: gathering data from multiple sources, assessing its quality and tidiness, cleaning and refining it, and finally, producing insightful visualizations to showcase findings.

Project Steps
- Data Gathering: Retrieve data from at least two different sources using various data-gathering methods. After extraction, combine the datasets into a unified structure for analysis.

- Data Assessment: Analyze the gathered data to identify potential quality and tidiness issues, such as missing values or inconsistencies.

- Data Cleaning: Address the issues identified in the assessment, including handling missing data, correcting data types, and standardizing formats to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- Data Storage Update: Replace the original data with the cleaned version, ensuring future processes can access accurate and tidy data.

- Data Analysis & Visualization: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) by producing visualizations on the cleaned dataset and answering a research question to showcase key insights.

# Outcomes
This project culminates in a professional data-wrangling workflow demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook, where the documented process serves as a resource for future data projects. By completing this project, you will gain valuable hands-on experience in the data wrangling lifecycle, making you well-prepared to tackle similar challenges in real-world scenarios.
